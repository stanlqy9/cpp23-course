## 📅 Progress Log

### Lesson 1:
**Focus:** Environment Setup

* **Tasks Completed:**
    * Basically just did some setups for Ninja, CMake and VS Code
    * Set up a docker container with GCC/Clang and CMake support to run my files.

* **Key Learnings:**
    * **C++ Modules:** Learned the difference between `import` and `#include`. Modules help with faster compilation times and better encapsulation.
    * **Docker Containers:** I finally somewhat learned what a docker container is. Basically it allows you to set up an
    vm with whatever packages or compilers you want to use insead of doing that on your own machine.
    * **CMake, Ninja & vcpkg:**: I sort of learned what each of these tools do. CMake: build system generator, Ninja:
    used alongside CMake but makes the build a lot faster, vcpkg: C++ package manager. 

* **Challenges Faced:**
    * None it was a pretty simple set up.
    * I would still say that I'm confused on whats inside those CMake files.

* **Random Comments:**
    * Docker is such a ram hog
    * It would be awesome if I could figure out how to make my own docker container
